        <br>

        <h3>About Mary </h3>
        <p>Mary enjoys primarily fiction, fantasy and anything involving magic. But occasionally enjoys a good <br>
        murder mystery or how-to books. By day she works at a Milwaukee software company and by night she can <br>
        be found playing with her dog Lana (named after Lana Kane), traveling the world, or of course curled up <br>
        reading a good book.
